# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: No automated testing required per constitution v1.0.0. Manual verification and code review ensure quality.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.

  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/

  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment

  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on
- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 0 - Navigation Access (Priority: P0 - Prerequisite) 🎯 REQUIRED

**Goal**: Enable users to discover and access the feature through the portal's navigation system

**Independent Test**: Login as authorized user, verify menu item appears, click it to reach feature landing page

**⚠️ Constitution Requirement (Principle VII)**: This user story is MANDATORY and MUST be completed before users can access any other feature functionality.

- [ ] T010 [US0] Add route configuration in src/routes.js for feature path and component
- [ ] T011 [US0] Add permission definition in src/constant/permissions.js
- [ ] T012 [US0] Add permission check in src/routePermissions.js for the feature route
- [ ] T013 [US0] Add menu item to navigation component (sidebar/header) with permission check
- [ ] T014 [US0] Create feature landing page component (can be minimal for now, expanded in US1+)
- [ ] T015 [US0] Test navigation flow: menu visibility, click routing, permission denial

**Checkpoint**: Feature is now accessible through portal UI - users with permissions can navigate to it

---

## Phase 4: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

- [ ] T016 [P][us1] Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].ts
- [ ] T017 [P][us1] Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].ts
- [ ] T018 [US1] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].ts (depends on T016, T017)
- [ ] T019 [US1] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].tsx
- [ ] T020 [US1] Add validation and error handling
- [ ] T021 [US1] Add logging for user story 1 operations

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

- [ ] T022 [P][us2] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].ts
- [ ] T023 [US2] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].ts
- [ ] T024 [US2] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].tsx
- [ ] T025 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 0, 1 AND 2 should all work independently

---

## Phase 6: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

- [ ] T026 [P][us3] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].ts
- [ ] T027 [US3] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].ts
- [ ] T028 [US3] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].tsx

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories
- [ ] TXXX [P] Manual testing and validation of all user stories
- [ ] TXXX Security hardening
- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **Navigation (Phase 3 - User Story 0)**: Depends on Foundational completion - REQUIRED by Constitution Principle VII
- **User Stories (Phase 4+)**: All depend on Navigation phase completion (users must be able to access the feature)
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 0 (P0 - Navigation)**: PREREQUISITE - Must complete first per Constitution Principle VII
- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Navigation (Phase 3) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Navigation (Phase 3) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Navigation (Phase 3) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All implementation tasks for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].ts"
Task: "Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].ts"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 0 + User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: Navigation (User Story 0) - REQUIRED
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 1
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 0 (navigation) and User Story 1 independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 0 (Navigation) → Test menu access → Navigation working
3. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
4. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Complete User Story 0 (Navigation) - PREREQUISITE
3. Once Navigation is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify functionality through manual testing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
